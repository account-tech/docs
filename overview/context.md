# Context

Two years into mainnet, Sui stands as Web3's most advanced blockchain - yet its revolutionary tech stack remains largely untapped. Despite leading the industry in technical capabilities, critical barriers to adoption prevent developers, organizations, and end users from fully leveraging Sui's powerful features.

* Developers are lacking frameworks and tools to iterate rapidly. (e.g., Developers must repeatedly implement basic Sui object handling and operations across every project)
* Organizations face critical operational risks. (e.g., Fragmented access control and package upgrades through Cap objects expose projects to security vulnerabilities without enterprise-grade management)
* End users are locked out of the system due to limited front-ends with poor UX. (e.g., Even simple NFT transfers are inaccessible to users due to complex Kiosk mechanics and limited wallet support)

Mysten Labs redefined the blockchain environment, but they canâ€™t power the whole ecosystem alone.

This is why we are building account.tech, a fully-featured tech stack empowering developers to build secure and user-friendly applications on Sui. From infrastructure, to DeFi, to AI, we're enabling the next generation of on-chain innovation by providing comprehensive infrastructure and turnkey solutions.
