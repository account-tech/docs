# Stack Components

### **Smart Account Standard & Framework**

We are establishing a new object standard on Sui that transforms basic addresses into powerful Smart Accounts. This extension of Sui accounts provides native support for all standardized Sui objects and essential built-in features, enabling developers to focus on innovation rather than rebuilding core functionality.

While Smart Accounts provide a secure execution layer, they remain fully customizable at the application level. Each project can implement its own rules and features while inheriting standardized security measures and base functionality. This unique approach combines enterprise-grade reliability with unlimited flexibility.

Our standardized interfaces simplify object management, offering developers an intuitive way to leverage Sui's object-centric model. The system operates on an intent-based architecture where actions must pass through configurable resolution rules before execution. This creates a powerful yet flexible framework where Move developers can freely define new actions and intents, either for specific applications or as reusable libraries.

### **Account Abstraction Infrastructure**

Our comprehensive TypeScript Library enables developers to build SDKs that abstract away the complexities of Sui's highly composable environment, providing other developers with a streamlined interface to their own Smart Account implementations. This powerful abstraction layer enables rapid integration of smart accounts into any application, dramatically reducing development time and complexity.

Full-stack teams can seamlessly incorporate smart accounts into their applications through intuitive APIs for asset management and intent-based actions. The various SDKs handle complex object relationships and state management behind the scenes while providing flexible extension points for custom package security and advanced features.

Our infrastructure roadmap extends beyond basic abstraction, with planned support for:

* Automated intent execution
* Gasless transactions
* Keyless authentication via zkLogin and passkeys
* Social recovery mechanisms

### **Enterprise Product Suite**

Our infrastructure powers a suite of production-ready solutions that set new standards for usability in the Sui ecosystem. Our flagship product is an enterprise-grade Multisig platform that simplifies on-chain operations and asset management. This comprehensive platform serves multiple critical needs:

* **Developers** gain secure package administration and upgrade capabilities
* **Creators** access turnkey tools for asset issuance and distribution
* **Teams** manage treasury operations, payments, and asset workflows seamlessly

Building on this foundation, we are expanding to power next-generation DAOs on Sui, bringing the same enterprise-grade security and comprehensive object support that distinguishes our Multisig solution. Every product in our suite is designed with a relentless focus on user experience, featuring intuitive interfaces that simplify complex operations while maintaining granular control when needed.

### **Rich Ecosystem**

Our vision extends beyond infrastructure and products to building an open, collaborative ecosystem that powers the next generation of consumer applications on Sui.

Momentum is already building, with several major Sui teams awaiting integration of our Multisig solution, and many developers leveraging our infrastructure. These teams are creating diverse applications ranging from trading bots and AI agents to launchpad solutions and consumer applications, demonstrating the versatility and power of our platform.

This growing adoption creates a powerful network effect: developers accelerate their development through our standardized infrastructure, users enjoy enhanced functionality across integrated applications, and each new integration strengthens the ecosystem's value proposition. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation and adoption that positions account.tech as essential infrastructure for Sui's future.
