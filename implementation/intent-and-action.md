# Intent and Action

You can define new actions and intents in addition to the ones provided by the framework. The new smart account could provide new features that would need new intents (e.g. an intent to configurate this specific `Account<Config>` object).

You might also want to make certain functions in your own packages executable by smart accounts, such as Multisigs. For this to work, you have to define these functions as intents.
